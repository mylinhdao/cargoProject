This is my solution for our programming task in modul Programming 3 (JAVA). 
The task is included in the source code in the file "Task.pdf". 
The task has different stages, where we realised different concepts. 
But in this source code, you can only see the end stage result. 

What I learned through this project:

    Architectures like MVC and MVVM;
    Design Patterns like Decoration, Facade, Observer,
    Testing with JUnit and Mockito
